## Introduction

We believe that achieving continuous delivery as part of DevOps in the federal government, subject to FISMA, requires a truly continuous application of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). While this can be done within the letter of NIST 800-37r2, we intend to advocate for a new authorization type or a new subset of ongoing authorization. This would require a particular implementation of the RMF for Continuous Delivery as part of Agile Software Development & Operations. 

The US Air Force pioneered such an implementation which resulted in a Continuous Authority to Operate (cATO). Since then, there has been little consensus on what a cATO is, much less how to implement the RMF to achieve one. In fact, many cATOs have completely diverged from RMF and cannot be considered FISMA compliant. **For that reason, we are proposing the term “cATO” no longer be used.** Even if the poor practices could be cleaned up, the name itself is problematic and cannot be found as an authorization type/decision within NIST 800-37. It was always intended to be a very opinionated subset of ongoing authorization with prescribed practices. We hope to codify this under a new authorization type/decision.

This manifesto and the [playbook](https://rise8-us.github.io/cato-playbook/) aim to align the community around achieving the “early and continuous delivery of valuable software” in federal government as promised by the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development*[^1]. Given that, we have intentionally stayed true to the format and content of the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development*[^1], highlighting how compliant DevOps naturally fits in.
